# VoiceProjectTracker
A simple, script-powered dashboard that scans your Google Drive voice-over folders, lists every file in a Google Sheet, lets you add “Final Production” links, track Current/Past status, and sync statuses with your separate Auditions tab. It also includes a small HTML UI (buttons, tabs, KPIs) you can open in the Sheet.
